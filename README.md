# git_test

I am starting to learn web developmet using The Odin Project!

My plan is to study everyday for 1 to 2 hours after I get home from work.

Day 1 covered basic git commands and set up to use git version control and Github. 

Day 2 covered HTML boilerplate and lists, along with Links and Images. I knew about this already but its a good refresher.

Day 3 completed first little project, Recipe Project.

Day 4 covered CSS Foundations plus completed exercise 1 for the topic.

Day 5 completed exercise two of the CSS Foundations topic, too tired to do any more; had a long day at work! 

Day 6 completed exercise three of the CSS Foundations topic to practice CSS grouping selectors.

Day 7 completed exercise 4 of the CSS Foundations topic to practice CSS chaining selectors. Pretty easy. 

Day 8 completed exercise 5 of the CSS Foundations topic to practice CSS descendant combinator. Last 2 days missed because my car got totaled, had to deal w that. 
**Went ahead and finished exercise 6, final one, for the CSS Foundations topic!
