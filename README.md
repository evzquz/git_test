# git_test

I am starting to learn web developmet using The Odin Project!

My plan is to study everyday for 1 to 2 hours after I get home from work.

Day 1 covered basic git commands and set up to use git version control and Github. 
Day 2 covered HTML boilerplate and lists, along with Links and Images. I knew about this already but its a good refresher.
